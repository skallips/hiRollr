This readme file is accociated with the Hirollr android application created by Alex and Carlitos.
The application consists of koitlin files, xml files, color, and style files. Our android app 
functions as a tool for gamblers who aren't controlled in their spending habits. Hirollr can assist
new and experienced gamblers become more responsible. Gambling alone can become very risky overtime 
but having HiRollr can save you time and money.

The various kotlin activities contain various tasks:
MainActivity - start of the application, the home page
LoginActivity - user signs into account
RegisterActivity - new users enter information to create account
DashboardActivity - sub start menu to direct users to register or start a gambling session
VenueActivity - User selects a casino venue and game type to start gambling session
SessionActivity - User selects gambling amounts, thresholds, and external factor settings to calculate their projected stopping point
PlayActivity - Displays to user the calculated amounts of thresholds and walk-away projection amount
ResultsActivity - User completes play session and enters ending amounts, displays whether goals were met or if thresholds were crossed

A DocumentActivity was ultimately not included in the program due to time constraints and implementation complications.  This activity would then take the 
data generated from the ResultsActivity and store it in a data structure that the user can access via their accound. The ability to review past sessions 
would have also be accessible from the DashboardActivity.

This program was created using AndroidStudio and was tested using a Pixel 3 virtual device.  This program also utilizes custom jpeg images created for logo and navigation displays.
